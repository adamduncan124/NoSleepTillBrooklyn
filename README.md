# NoSleepTillBrooklyn
This application keeps your machine awake, and is themed around a Beastie Boys song.  It is a windows form exe.

--About the Application
This application has a button to start, or to sleep the app on the main form.  If you click "Start Trip", every 60 seconds the application calls the F15 key.  You'll see in the source where i tried to just move the mouse around, but that didn't work.  Call the function keys appears to work best on Windows 7 and 10, which were the only machines I've used this on.  I can walk away for hours, and the machine would still not be in hibernation mode.

--Usage Details
You can download the SourceCode folder to see the source for this process, or you can download the Application if you just want the exe its self.  The music folder can be deleted if you don't want to store the .wav file that plays No Sleep Till Brooklyn
